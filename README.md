## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A
  [Telegram API key](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/quickstart#enjoy-the-api)
  and a Telegram account
- Choose plugins you need, install dependencies which listed above and run
  `pip install -U -r requirements.txt` to install Python package dependencies
  as well
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

## Run

Choose one of the two methods and run the userbot with
`python userbot.py`, stop with <kbd>CTRL+c</kbd>. The following example assume
that you were going to use `vc.player` and `ping` plugin, replace
`api_id`, `api_hash` to your own value.

### Method 1: use config.ini

Create a `config.ini` file

```
[pyrogram]
api_id = 1234567
api_hash = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

[plugins]
root = plugins
include =
    vc.player
    ping
    sysinfo
```

### Method 2: write your own userbot.py

Replace the file content of `userbot.py`

```
from pyrogram import Client, idle

api_id = 1234567
api_hash = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"

plugins = dict(
    root="plugins",
    include=[
        "vc.player",
        "ping",
        "sysinfo"
    ]
)

app = Client("tgvc", api_id, api_hash, plugins=plugins)
app.start()
print('>>> USERBOT STARTED')
idle()
app.stop()
print('\n>>> USERBOT STOPPED')
```
